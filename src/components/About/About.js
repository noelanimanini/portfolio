          Fullstack software engineer with a background in neuroscience and a
          love for language. I have always been the sort of person who seeks
          consensus, my approach to leadership is collaborative and
          team-oriented. I believe the most effective technical solutions are
          realized when all stakeholder perspectives are valued.
